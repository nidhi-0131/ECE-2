    <!-- What are Sementic Elements?
        Semantic elements in HTML are tags that clearly describe their meaning and purpose to 
        both the browser and the developer. They help structure a webpage in a meaningful way.
        For example: header, footer, article, section, nav, aside, etc.
         What are Non-Sementic Elements?
        Non-semantic elements are HTML tags that do not describe their content. They are mainly 
        used for layout or grouping content, but they don’t give meaning to what’s inside.
        For example: <div>, <span>, etc. -->
