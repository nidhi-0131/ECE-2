<!-- Q1. What is HTML? Write a short definition and list three key features of HTML in your own words. -->
    <!-- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It tells the browser
     what content to display, such as headings, images, links, or paragraphs.
     Key Features of HTML:
     1. Structure Content: HTML organizes content using elements like headings, lists, tables, and paragraphs to form the layout 
        of a webpage.
     2. Uses Tags: HTML is based on opening and closing tags (like <h1>, <p>, <img>) that describe the purpose of each piece of 
        content.
     3. Supports Multimedia: It allows adding images, audio, video, and links to make web pages interactive and visually appealing. -->
